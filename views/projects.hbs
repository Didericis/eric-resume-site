            Early in 2015, I designed and implemented the website for the Parent Exchange Network, a conference organizaion formed to help edulcate and support parents raising children from toddlers to teenagers. The website was done in wordpress, as the owners requested, and will launch once the organization is official. To visit, click <a href="//www.parentexchangenetwork.com/">here</a>.

            During the summer of 2014 I worked on a website for a friend in the Heathcare Industry. We were experimenting with an idea for a startup that involved analyzing social media data. To accomplish this, I created a node bot to suck up tweets in a few major cities over the period of a week. Mongodb was used to store the tweets. The website was private and allowed my friend and a statistitian to easily export data for analysis, neither of whom had experience with javascript or mongodb. An early, console based version of the export tool can be found <a href="//github.com/Didericis/mongo-xlsx">here</a>.
